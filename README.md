# A Quantum Walk Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for Category Data Clustering

## Overview
This source code implements the experiments described in the paper “Quantum Walk Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm Hybrid K-modes for Clustering.” In this paper, we propose a Quantum Walk Artificial Bee Colony Hybrid K-means Clustering Algorithm (QWABC-K) to address the shortcomings of the K-modes algorithm, which is prone to local optima and sensitive to initial cluster centers. First, we design a discrete quantum walk model with two target nodes to enhance the optimization efficiency of both worker bees and observer bees. Second, we introduce an adaptive rotation angle update strategy based on quantum turnstiles, applied during the scout bee phase and combined with a global guidance factor to improve solution quality. Third, an elite population grouping strategy is developed to dynamically adjust the population structure, guiding the population toward different evolutionary directions through a directed approach. Finally, experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed QWABC-K algorithm.
